## Creating new tournament notebook
1. Add tournament_scores in csv format into [tourney_data/raw_scores](https://github.com/akash-suresh/three-of-spades/tree/main/tourney_data/raw_scores). (follow same naming convention for the csv file as earlier tournaments)
2. Add tournament entry in [TOURNAMENT_LIST_CHRONOLOGICAL](https://github.com/akash-suresh/three-of-spades/blob/main/utils/constants.py#L52) list.
3. Run the notebook- [notebook_gen.ipynb](https://github.com/akash-suresh/three-of-spades/blob/main/notebook_gen.ipynb) to generate all tournament notebooks!
4. Commit and raise a Pull request!
